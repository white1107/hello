        <p>Nobunaga was head of the very powerful Oda clan, and launched
         a war against other daimyos to unify 
        Japan in the 1560s. Nobunaga emerged as the most powerful daimyo, 
        overthrowing the nominally ruling shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki and dissolving the
         Ashikaga Shogunate in 1573. He conquered most of Honshu island by 1580, and 
         defeated the Ikkō-ikki rebels in the 1580s. Nobunaga's rule was noted for innovative 
         military tactics, fostering of free trade, reforms of Japan's civil government, 
         and the start of the Momoyama historical art period, but also for the brutal suppression of 
         those who refused to cooperate or yield to his demands. Nobunaga was killed in the Honnō-ji
          Incident in 1582, when his retainer Akechi Mitsuhide ambushed him in Kyoto and forced him to commit seppuku. 
        Nobunaga was succeeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who along with Tokugawa Ieyasu completed his war of unification shortly afterwards.</p>
